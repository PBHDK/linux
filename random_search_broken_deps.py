# generate random config

# make sure its a sensible config
#   - arch?
#   - enable debug symbols

# build random config and attach to output

# for every output: 
#   check if we have already seen it
#   if yes, discard
#   if no, print it to file and add it to hashmap

# if we have found at least one new broken dependency, save the corresponding
# config somewhere
